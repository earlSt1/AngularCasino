# AngularApp - Casino

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

This application is a training exercise for myself, learning how Angular applications are built.

### So far the application has the following features:
- Spring security connected to a database of your choice (I am using MySQL), using JWT to authenticate users throughout the application
- Start to a Blog page, where users can comment on blog posts and rate them. (All handled by a Spring REST controller)
- A very simple Blackjack game the user can play, with an AI that plays against them. (This is all done in Angular)

### Currently working on:
- Blog functionality

### Planned additions:
- User profile page with generic information
- Image upload system for the blog and user avatars.
- Expanding on the Casino idea, adding new casino games to learn more angular (Poker would be interesting to try and implement)
- Some kind of currency tied to the user (so you can bet on casino games)
